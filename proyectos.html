            My duty in this project was, as the Front-End, to build interface with Pug and CSS, integrate it with <strong>Angular JS</strong> (it was tons of fun!);
            as the Back-End, use Express JS as a middleware with <strong>Node JS</strong>, create an MVC architecture and make an quick and efficient database with <strong>SQL</strong>.

            Here my duty was different since I had to apply my knowledge in C# with ASP.Net. First I had to re-desing every page and migrate it from pure <strong>HTML</strong>
            to HTML5 with CSS (<strong>Bootstrap</strong>). A lot of code had to be re-coded since there was a lot of uncompatible stuff.
            Then I got involved in the Back-End, and had to do some hotfixes and recode some stored procedures in the <strong>SQL</strong> database.
            This app was all made with <strong>Visual Basic</strong> and <strong>ASP.NET</strong>.
